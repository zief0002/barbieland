## Welcome to EPsy 5261: Introductory Statistical Methods

EPSY 5261 is designed to engage students in statistics by first building a conceptual understanding of statistics through the use of simulation methods and then learning about the more traditional methods, such as t-tests and regression. This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion. 

:::fyi
**Attention undergraduates:** As this is a graduate level course, it does not fulfill the [Mathematical Thinking Liberal Education requirement](https://onestop.umn.edu/academics/undergraduate/lib-ed-requirements-overview/liberal-education-requirements). If you would like to take a statistics course in our department that fulfills that requirement, please consider EPSY 3264.
:::

EPsy 5261 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see [Expected Student Academic Work Policy](https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentwork)). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10--15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that---it all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course.

### CACREP Standard(s) Covered in EPSY 5261 (for Counselor Ed. Students reference)

As a result of taking this course, Counselor Education students will:

- Learn about quantitative research methods **(2.F.8.f)**
- Understand how to use randomized control design in research **(2.F.8.g)**
- Learn statistical methods used in conducting research **(2.F.8.h)**
- Understand ways to analyze and use data in counseling **(2.F.8.i)**
- Identify ethical and culturally relevant strategies for conducting, interpreting, and reporting the results of research **(2.F.8.j)**

<br />


## Audience and prerequisites 

This course is intended for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who have completed a high school algebra course. Although there are no formal prerequisites for this course, students should have familiarity with computers and technology (e.g., internet browsing, Microsoft Word, opening/saving/attaching files, etc.).

<br />


## Course Goals, Objectives and Expectations

Upon completion of this course, students should (1) have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation and inference; (2) be able to think critically about statistics used in popular magazines, newspapers, and journal articles; (3) be able to apply the knowledge gained in the course to analyze simple statistics used in research; and (4) be able to investigate research questions using a large data set, use a statistical software package to analyze the data, and appropriately report the conclusions from data study.

**This is not a traditional class where you only come each day, listen, watch, take notes, and work entirely on your own.** This class was developed under the inverted classroom model which has a lot of research-based support. The inverted classroom "inverts" the traditional instructor-centered classroom model and has you, the student, play a more active role in your learning. You will be required to first read about a topic yourself. Then, classroom time will be devoted to learning activities and discussions to further develop and help you understand the topic. Finally, you will solve problems on homework related to the topic. 

This course makes extensive use of small group activities and large group discussions to solidify ideas and content, as well as to deepen your understanding of material encountered in the readings. Your learning experience is thus dependent–to some extent–on your classmates and vice versa. Because of this, *it is essential that you not only attend class each day and participate in the activities and discussions, but that you show up prepared having completed the reading.*

Although attempts have been made to make this course as flexible as possible, there are weekly deadlines that are essential in order to ensure that everyone moves through the course at the same pace and completes the assignments in the same order. 

Statistics is more than just an application of mathematics or a methodology used in some other discipline. Statistics is a principled way of thinking about the world. In particular, it is a principled approach to data collection, prediction, and scientific inference.

Statistics is itself a unique discipline that has, like many others, undergone a tremendous amount of growth and change in the last two decades. In today’s dynamic and interdisciplinary world, success in confronting new analytical issues requires both substantial knowledge of a scientific or technological area and highly flexible problem-solving strategies.

Internalizing a discipline's way of thinking about and solving problems is a time consuming process, with the key word being "process". It is not something that can be taught to students in a semester, or even year–long, course. Learning statistics takes much more than memorizing formulae or software commands. It requires active participation and questioning both in and out of the classroom. The instructor of this course will provide you with many opportunities to learn the material through class activities, readings, and lab assignments, but in the end, you will have to do all of the hard work of actually learning that material.

### Professionalism

Evidence of professional practice on both our parts includes (a) starting and ending on time, (b) being prepared, (c) being physically and mentally engaged, (d) performing at a high level, (e) making sure cell phones are off, and (f) refraining from sending and receiving e-mail, playing solitaire, shopping, texting, tweeting, and facebooking during class. Thank you.

:::inclusion
### A Note on Inclusion and Respect

In this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another's individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class.

<br />


## Classroom

- Tuesday/Thursday (1:00pm&ndash;2:15pm): [Bruininks Hall 530B](https://campusmaps.umn.edu/robert-h-bruininks-hall)


<br />


## Textbooks and Materials

The course textbook is available for free online. (There is no physical copy of the textbook, but you can print it out if that is a better option for you.)

- **Required:** Zieffler, A., &amp; Legacy, C. (2023). [An Introduction to Data Analysis](https://zief0002.github.io/epsy-5261/).

- A variety of readings will be provided via the course website throughout the semester. These readings come from different sources–such as journal articles and online resources–and explain terms and concepts, or provide additional information not covered in the textbook. Some of the readings are journal and news articles that report about research studies or data analyses that are related to topics addressed in class activities. These have more detail than you need to know for the course, but they provide real-world examples of the statistical questions and methods you are learning about. 

<br />


## Course Requirements and Grading

### Lab Assignments

There will be 4 lab (homework) assignments that together are worth 25% of your grade. The lab assignments will be completed outside of class (as homework) and submitted electronically via the course website. 

As a student of statistics, working through all of the lab assignments is an important piece in building a complete understanding of the concepts, as well as allowing you to practice doing statistics. As a way of connecting the work you are doing across all lab assignments, you will explore the same data set for each lab assignment.

You can download and view a PDF of the lab assignment from the [Course Schedule page of the website](#schedule). For each lab assignment, you may choose to work alone or in a group. Working in a group may allow you to explore answers to a question with other students before submitting your lab assignment. Your lab assignment should be submitted via the course website before the end of the day that they are due (i.e., by 11:59 PM that day). 

<br />


### Exams

There is a midterm and a final exam, which together are worth a total of 50% of your grade. These exams are take-home and are to be completed independently. In this course, you may use any materials you like to complete exams (e.g., your book, your notes, internet resources, etc.) but you may not consult with other people or talk with your peers as you are taking exams. If it is discovered that collaboration has occurred on the exam, you will receive a grade of 0 on that exam and be turned in for academic dishonesty.

You will have one week to work on each exam outside of class and then submit your work to the instructor via the course website. The exams will involve using statistical software (R). More details about the structure of each of these exams will be given later. 

<!-- **Group Discussions:** You will participate in regular group discussion activities, and the purpose of these activities is for you to apply what you are reading about and to help each other learn important content in the course.  These are also great opportunities for you to ask questions and get more detailed help from your peers, the instructor, or the TA. Note that the instructor and/or TA will be monitoring your discussions each week. However, just as we would not be able to hear every single group discussion if you were in a physical classroom, we may not have time to carefully read every single word posted by members of your group or correct every single mistake we see. However, we will read as many posts as we can and try to guide your group in the right direction.  -->

<!-- One important component of this course is **active student participation**. Although the textbook, course materials, instructor, and teaching assistant are important sources of information, so too are your classmates. To facilitate interaction among your classmates, I will break you into small discussion groups at the beginning of the semester, and you will be required to interact with your discussion group frequently throughout the semester.  -->

<!-- For each discussion, the group must attempt to talk about a particular topic/concept and answer certain questions about this topic/concept.  -->


<br />


### ChatGPT and Other AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, may be used to help you write R syntax with appropriate citation, but not for answering any of the questions on the assignment. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA. Examples of citing AI language models are available at: <https://libguides.umn.edu/chatgpt>. You are responsible for ensuring any syntax composed by AI is correct.

<br />


:::absence
### Policy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work

Students are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to [University Policy](https://policy.umn.edu/education/makeupwork). If you miss class:

- Email the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.
- Students are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.
- Please note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.
  + If you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.
- If you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment. 

If you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.

<br />


### Evaluation of Student Performance

Course grades will be based entirely on performance on the homework assignments. The points from the eight homework assignment will be pooled to compute a percentage in the class, which will be converted to a final course grade using:

Cutoff    | Grade | Definition for Graduate Credit |
--------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
93%--100% | A     | For exceptional work, well above the minimum criteria | 
90%--92%  | A--   | For outstanding work, well above the minimum criteria | 
87%--89%  | B+    | For excellent work, significant above the minimum criteria | 
83%--86%  | B     | For work above the minimum criteria |
80%--82%  | B--   | |
77%--79%  | C+    | |
73%--76%  | C     | For work which meets the course requirements in every respect |
70%--72%  | C--   | |
63%--69%  | D     | Worthy of credit even though it fails to meet the course requirements |
0%--62%   | F     | Failed to meet minimum course requirements |

If you are taking the course S/N, the minimum criterion to receive an S is 80% (the equivalent of a B-- letter grade). The S grade does not carry grade points and is not part of the GPA calculation, but the credits will count toward the student's degree program if allowed by the college, campus, or program.

*Any student who does not complete all homework assignments without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.*

<br />


### Incomplete

Instructors may assign the registration symbol "I" for Incomplete if, at the time the incomplete is requested: (1) the student has successfully completed a substantial portion of the work of the course; and (2) due to extraordinary circumstances (*as determined by the instructor*), the student was prevented from completing the work of the course on time. The assignment of an "I" requires a written agreement with the student specifying the time and manner in which the student will complete the course requirements. For more information see [Grading and Transcripts](https://policy.umn.edu/education/gradingtranscripts).

<br />


### Accessing Course Grades

Shortly after the course, you may access your grades online at [myU](http://myu.umn.edu). Assignments will be handed back in class or during office hours. Uncollected assignments will be retained for six weeks after the course and then discarded.

<br />


:::stress
### Stress Management

Stress management is an important piece of the skill set needed for success in graduate school. Pet Away Worry & Stress (PAWS) is one of the many resources available to students. Find out more at [https://boynton.umn.edu/paws](https://boynton.umn.edu/paws).

## Statistical Computing and Technology

Statistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 5261. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

You can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (Information about how to download and use the software can be found in the technology reference guide on the course website.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.

<br />


:::technology
### Technology Policy

The course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies---including printer trouble---will not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.
